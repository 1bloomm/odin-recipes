        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Made this delicious fluffy Naan the other day paired with a delicious Butter Chicken, but I was slamming down the Naan like no other. The image above is of course it paired with the chicken, but we will not be covering that in this.</p>
    
        <h3><em>Ingredient List and Tools</em></h3>
        <ul><strong>Tools to Make Life Easier</strong>
                <li>Cast Iron Skillet</li>
                <li>Couple Mixing Bowl</li>
                <li>Rubber Spatula</li>
            
            
            </ul>


            <ul>
                <li>1 tsp instant/rapid-rise yeast</li>
                <li>1/2 cup warm tap water</li>
                <li>1 tbsp white sugar</li>
                <li>2 tbsp whole milk</li>
                <li>1 1/2 tbsp whisked egg</li>
                <li>1 3/4 cup bread flour (all-purpose)</li>
                <li>2 tbsp ghee or unsalted butter (melted) </li>

            </ul>

        <h3><em>Steps</em></h3>
            
            <ol>
                <li>Mix the <em>yeast</em> with the <em>warm water</em> and <em>sugar</em> in small bowl and wrap and leave until foamy.</li>
                <li>Whisk the <em>egg</em> and <em>milk</em> together</li>
                <li>Add <em>flour</em> and <em>salt</em> to a separate bowl/sift them together (not that important to me but who am I)</li>
                <li>Make a well in the <em>flour</em>, and add the yeast mixture, then the <em>butter</em> and egg mixture. Mix that all together with a rubber spatula (or any or hell even your hands like I did).
                Once the flour is basically all mixed in start to bring it together into a ball shape. No kneading is required! </li>
                <li><strong>Time for the proof</strong>- Cover the bowl and leave it on the counter for 1 - 1.5 hrs until it looks around double in size. </li>
                <li>Cut into 6 even pieces and shape back into balls. To do this I like to flour my hands up well and press down and tuck the sides up so it almost looks like a dumpling and then roll it in hands.</li>
                <li><strong>Time for proof 2!</strong> Place the 6 balls on a lightly floured tray and throw a dash of flour on top (literally a dash and sometimes i like to smooth it out? does not matter too much I have seen). Cover lightly with a towel, any clean dish towel will work (my girlfriend bought IKEA fruit looking ones and they work perfect). Leave for a rough 15 minutes or until about 50% bigger.</li>
                <li>Time to roll them out also maybe refer to next step to take on a challenge for more efficient workflow, if you are like me and said "ah shit I don't have a bread roller" just use a glass cup or plastic and rub some flour on the outside and easy pickin's. Lightly flour a tray or any surface you have been using, flatten the balls with your hands and then start rolling them out to thin....but not too thin. Think a nice flat surface that could hold some chicken on there without being absolutely useless. <strong>SIZE DOESN'T MATTER...(that much)</strong></li>
                <li>Heat up that skillet, if already well seasoned. If not, rub a light layer of oil or throw some more butter if you are lazy asf (a reasonable amount not a massive glob, but also more than enough to butter a piece of bread). Set over high heat until you see wisps of smoke. Don't burn your house down though, open a window so someone can get in i</li>
